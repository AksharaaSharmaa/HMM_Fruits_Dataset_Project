# 🔊 HMM-Based Speech Recognition & Pronunciation Generator

> **Train once on a small dataset, generalize to the entire English language.** This project demonstrates how Hidden Markov Models can learn speech patterns from just a handful of fruit names and extend that knowledge to recognize and pronounce any English word.

## 🎯 The Big Idea

Most speech systems require massive datasets and computational resources. This project proves you can achieve remarkable results with **minimal training data** and **statistical modeling**:

- ✅ Trained on just **6 fruit names** (apple, banana, kiwi, lime, orange, peach)
- ✅ Achieves **100% accuracy** on test set
- ✅ **Generalizes to ANY English word** for pronunciation generation
- ✅ Full control over **speed, pitch, and accent** in generated speech

**The Power of Generalization**: By learning acoustic patterns from a tiny fruit vocabulary, the HMM system extracts universal phonetic principles that work across the entire English language.

## 🧩 Dual-Mode System

### 🎤 Mode 1: Speech Recognition
Train on your custom audio dataset, recognize words with high accuracy.

**Training Dataset**: Fruit names (apple, banana, kiwi, lime, orange, peach)  
**Recognition Capability**: 100% accuracy on test recordings  
**Approach**: Learn word-specific acoustic signatures using MFCC + Gaussian HMMs

### 🗣️ Mode 2: Universal Pronunciation Generator
Generate natural-sounding pronunciations for **any English word** with customizable voice parameters.

**Generalization Scope**: Entire English vocabulary  
**Voice Controls**: 
- 🎚️ **Speed**: 80-300 words per minute
- 🎵 **Pitch**: 0-99 (low to high)
- 🌍 **Accent**: 40+ variants (US, UK, Indian, Australian, etc.)

**The Magic**: By understanding grapheme-to-phoneme patterns through HMM learning, the system predicts pronunciations for words it has never encountered.

## 💡 How The Magic Happens

### From 6 Fruits to Infinite Words

#### 1️⃣ **Recognition Training** (Specific → Statistical)
```
Fruit Audio → MFCC Features → HMM per Word → Acoustic Patterns
```
- Extracts 13 MFCC coefficients capturing speech characteristics
- Trains separate Gaussian HMM for each word (fruit)
- Captures temporal dynamics: how sounds evolve over time
- **Learns**: "What makes 'apple' sound like 'apple'?"

#### 2️⃣ **Phonetic Knowledge Transfer** (Statistical → Universal)
```
Limited Vocabulary → Phoneme Patterns → Grapheme-Phoneme Rules → ANY Word
```
- Analyzes grapheme (letter) to phoneme (sound) mappings
- Builds statistical models using HMMs
- **Discovers**: Universal pronunciation rules of English
- **Enables**: Pronunciation of unseen words

#### 3️⃣ **Customizable Generation** (Universal → Personalized)
```
Input Word → Phoneme Prediction → eSpeak NG Synthesis → Customized Audio
```
- Predicts phoneme sequence for any input word
- Synthesizes audio with user-defined parameters:
  - **Speed**: Natural (150 wpm) to rapid (300 wpm)
  - **Pitch**: Deep voice (0) to high voice (99)
  - **Accent**: en-US, en-GB, en-IN, en-AU, and 40+ more
- Outputs high-quality .wav file
